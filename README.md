# Tria Nexus Contacts

This is a simple contact management web app built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
The app lets you add contacts, view them in a clean glass-styled layout, and search through them easily using the search bar.
All data is stored in local state — no backend or database is used.

## Design Notes

The main idea was to create a **clean and futuristic contact list** using gradients, blur effects, and subtle motion.
I chose a glassmorphic look because it feels modern and helps the content stand out without too many colors.
The UI is kept minimal and easy to navigate.

## Future Improvements

* Option to edit or delete contacts.
* Persistent storage using localStorage or an API.
* Sorting and grouping contacts alphabetically.
